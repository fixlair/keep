## Connecting with the Provider

1. Centreon can be SaaS or On-premises. You need to have an instance of Centreon running.
2. Authenticate using your Centreon username and password. The provider will obtain an `X-AUTH-TOKEN` which is used for subsequent requests.
3. Use the URL of your Centreon instance together with your credentials to configure the provider.
   The URL can include the `/centreon` path (e.g. `https://example.com/centreon`)
   or simply the host name. The provider will handle both forms correctly.
