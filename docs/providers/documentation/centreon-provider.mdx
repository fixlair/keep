## Connecting with the Provider

1. Centreon can be SaaS or On-premises. You need to have an instance of Centreon running.
2. Provide either an API token or your Centreon username and password.
3. Use the URL of your Centreon instance together with the chosen credentials to configure the provider.
   The URL can include the `/centreon` path (e.g. `https://example.com/centreon`)
   or simply the host name. The provider will handle both forms correctly.
